# Regression-Model-in-Keras
Implementation of neural networks in python with Keras


In this course project, I created a regression model using the Keras library, which is a tool for deep learning. 
Once I built the initial model, I had the opportunity to explore and experiment with two important aspects: 
the number of training epochs and the number of hidden layers. 
By adjusting these parameters, one can observe how they affect the performance of the model. 
This will provide us with valuable insights into how different choices impact the accuracy and effectiveness of the model built.

a)- Assignment Topic:

In this project, you will build a regression model using the Keras library to model the same data about concrete compressive strength that we used in labs 3.

b)- Concrete Data:

For your convenience, the data can be found here again: 
https://cocl.us/concrete_data

To recap, the predictors in the data of concrete strength include:

-Cement

-Blast Furnace Slag

-Fly Ash

-Water

-Superplasticizer

-Coarse Aggregate

-Fine Aggregate
